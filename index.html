        <p>I love playing soccer, lifting weights, and experimenting in the kitchen. I've also always been drawn to solving problems, whether that be on the field or through a screen. My interest in tech started later in sophomore year of high school, with my very first Intro to Python class.</p>
        
        <p>At the University of Washington, I decided to study Computer science, where I've learned how impactful efficient software can be. This summer, I interned at <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoDaddy" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a></b>, where I worked with the SRE and Security team. GoDaddy gave me the incredible oppurtunity to learn to work fast, ship production-ready code, and take ownership across many areas.</p>
        
        <p>Recently, I've worked on two projects. This summer I built a YARA transpiler for GoDaddy that used LLMs and a custom reasoning process to convert messy, unstructured malware signatures into normalized YARA rules. I learned a lot about cybersecurity, prompt chaining, and how to design scalable AI-driven systems that can adapt to new data formats.</p>
        
        <p>On my own time, I built a <a href="https://github.com/nathansimonproj/yt-music-to-spotify" target="_blank"><b>playlist migrator</b></a> from YouTube Music to Spotify so I could join all my friends shared playlists on Spotify. What started as a small side project taught me a lot about API design, secure OAuth flows, and the enjoyability of building small tools that make everyday life a little smoother.</p>
        
        <p>I'm currently exploring iOS development using Swift and building webpages using React.</p>
